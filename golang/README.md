# Projet-ELP

This project (called the Project) is made for the subject ELP of the 3rd year program of the Telecoms Department of INSA Lyon Engineering School.

The Project outputs the tonality of a given song.
From a .wav file, it will analyze the most used notes of the song, and deduce what tonality it is in.

Current progress:
- [x] Can read a .wav file
- [x] Can intercorrelate the input with a chosen note
- [ ] Can calculate the most used notes of the input
- [ ] Can deduce from the most used notes the tonality of the input
